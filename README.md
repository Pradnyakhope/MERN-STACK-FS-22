Project Title: DOM Manipulation - Styling a Div

Project Description:
This project demonstrates how to manipulate the appearance of a div element using the Document Object Model (DOM). Specifically, we change the color, background color, margin, padding, font size, font weight, height, and width of a div dynamically using JavaScript. The aim is to practice DOM manipulation techniques while maintaining consistent user interface (UI) styling.


The UI remains consistent across all stages of the project, ensuring elements are aligned and visually appealing to provide a pleasant user experience.
DOM Manipulation with getElementById 

We use the getElementById method to target the div element by its ID. The fetched element is stored in a variable for further manipulation.
Background Color Change

The background color of the div is set to yellow using the style.backgroundColor property.
Margin Adjustment

A margin of 20 pixels is applied to the div using the style.margin property.
Padding Application 

Padding of 10 pixels is added to the div using the style.padding property.
Font Size Change

The font size of the div content

The font weight is changed to bold using the style.fontWeight property.
Height Adjustment

The height of the div is set to 200 pixels using the style.height property.
Width Adjustment 

The width of the div is modified to 300 pixels using the style.width property.
